HELLO EVERYONE READING THIS!!!

This is the first OFFICIAL blog post! If you are reading this the day it is published... it means you are a maniac and probably stalk me!

This is a bit of a post to look back at, and I suppose to document the process of even MAKING this damn blog!
Moreso for the people in the future looking back a billion blogposts and reading this, and see where this blog started!
(or digging through my github to see an abandoned project, doh!)

<!-- more -->

ANYWAYS, we want to make lil bloggy stuff, twitter is annoying and i think we like to keep to ourselves a lot of the time. 
We don't like comments so don't expect some mf forum or someshit around here. 

This is also a general revamp of the funkin website, since we are trying to be more legit and real and PRESENTABLE!!!

Lil tech details... this blog is made with ZOLA STATIC SITE GENERATOR!!!

I have been trying to chip away on this blog every day for at least 20mins-1hr, and it has been fun lil side adventure heheh.
